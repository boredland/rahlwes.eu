As a cultural scientist, I research the cultural, social, and political contexts in which artworks, texts, and institutions have emerged. I am particularly interested in questions of memory culture and memory politics, as our handling of the past here directly affects current and future debates.",
  "team.ellen.text": "Culture is created through and in exchange, which is why interdisciplinary perspectives are important to me in my work. After studying in Berlin and Paris, I began my doctoral research in 2018 on Aby Warburg at the intersection of cultural studies, philosophy, and Jewish studies. I find new inspiration for my research through participation in conferences, exhibitions, and editorial projects. My goal is to inspire enthusiasm for cultural studies topics and to foster curiosity about the cultural exchange processes in which we are all involved.",

As a 16-year-old, I started getting involved in historical and political education at the Anne Frank Educational Center, and it has been my concern ever since to tell complex historical connections in a way that is understandable to everyone. In 2013, I decided to offer historical research as a service. I am supported in my work by Ellen Rinner.",
